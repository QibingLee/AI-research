# AI Research Papers


This repository is meant to reorganize six projects that I built from 2016 to 2018, including: 1) a generic data mining visualization tool; 2) a Weibo social network mining system; 3) a video effect rendering engine; 4) a user-generated video sharing platform; 5) a 3D-roaming maze for graphic lighting. All of them are now open-sourced. The technical implementations and design philosophies can be found in each sub-repository. Disclaimer: these projects are built several years ago, and therefore some functions may be deprecated.
